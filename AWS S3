When one uploads an object to a S3 bucket.

Is there an API to check if the upload was successful ?

AmazonS3 amazonS3 = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard() .with* ... .build(); PutObjectResult result = this.amazonS3.putObject(s3BucketName, s3Key, file);

I read some solutions where

the MD5 checksum is compared to the file's MD5 signature
or the last modified date is compared

PS : I came from this old question How can I get upload success status with Amazon Web Services?
